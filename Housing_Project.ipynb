    "In the rapidly evolving real estate market, accurately predicting house prices is essential for both buyers and sellers to make informed decisions. The challenge lies in understanding the various factors that influence house values and effectively modeling these relationships to forecast prices. This project aims to tackle this challenge by applying Bayesian Regression and other machine learning techniques to predict median house values in California.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this study contains detailed information about different housing attributes, such as median income, housing median age, total rooms, bedrooms, population, households, and proximity to the ocean. By analyzing and modeling these features, this project seeks to provide insights into the key factors driving house prices and develop a robust predictive model. The results will not only aid potential buyers and sellers but also offer valuable insights for real estate analysts and investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this project, we will navigate the entire data science pipeline: from data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering, to model building, evaluation, and interpretation. The goal is to create a comprehensive and accessible analysis that can serve as a valuable resource for understanding and predicting housing market trends."
